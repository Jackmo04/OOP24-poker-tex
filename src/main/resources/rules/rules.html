    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A game is composed of a series of <b>hands</b>. Each hand progresses as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        Two cards are dealt face down to each player, and then a total of five community cards are dealt face up during the four <b>phases</b> of the game. (see <i>Game Phases</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
        Each player seeks the <b>best poker combination</b> obtainable from the seven cards at their disposal (the five community cards plus their two personal cards). (see <i>Combinations</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
        During each phase the players are allowed to make bets which will be added to a <b>pot</b>. The player who has the best <b>combination</b> at the end of the hand, or is the only player who hasn't <i>folded</i>, wins the pot. (see <i>Betting</i>)
